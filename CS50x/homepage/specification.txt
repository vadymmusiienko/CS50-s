HTML tags I've used:
<div>
<h1>
<a>
<img>
<b>
<iframe>
<br>
<p>
<h4>
<link>

CSS properties I've used:
font-family
text-align
color
background-color
min-height

I used Bootstrap for my About and Experience page. I used their alerts to impliment descriptions in columns.
I used JavaScript for my About page. I used JS to show more content about me when a user clicks on "more...click here".
Also I added a secret feature, when hover over homepage (my favorite assignment) it becomes a hyperlink and changes its name to "HOME".
